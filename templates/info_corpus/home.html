  <h2>Nuṣūṣ: A Corpus of Neglected Texts</h2>
  <p>This project started as a way to make early Sufi and Sufi-adjacent texts available to scholars to read and use for textual analysis. There are a variety of other digitized textual corpora for Islamicate sources, but Sufi texts are severely underrepresented. It is in light of this that I started nuṣūṣ to OCR, correct, and encode a variety of early Sufi and Sufi-adjacent works. However, it is clear that Sufi works are only one such genres\types of texts that are also neglected in such corpora. Nuṣūṣ therefore aims to include such genres as kalām and falsafa alongside the existing Sufi and Sufi-adjacent texts. 
  <p>The texts currently in the corpus have been encoded according to the Open Islamicate Text Initiative's mARkdown schema and, at some point in the near future, will be made available to download. For more information on the corpus, <a href="/corpus/">click here</a>.
