  <h2>Corpus Details</h2>
  <p>We initially envisoned Nuṣūṣ as a database for early Sufi texts not included in other digitized corpora, but the project has since expanded to include <em>falsafa</em>, <em>kalām</em>, and Christian theological works.</p>
  <p>To digitize these texts, we use <a href="https://www.escriptorium.uk/">eScriptorium,</a> a digital palaeography framework, which uses the <a href="https://kraken.re/master/index.html">kraken</a> OCR engine. For our project we use a kraken OCR model developped by the <a href="https://openiti.org/">OpenITI team</a>.</p>
  <p>Although the goal of Nuṣūṣ is to digitize and make available new texts, we have decided to include some works that have already been digitized and are extant in other corpora. Our reasoning for this to consolidate Sufi, <em>falsafa</em>, and <em>kalām</em> texts in one corpus and to increase the utility of our database and its search functionality. Texts imported from other corpora are marked as such in Nuṣūṣ.</p>
  <p>We have an internal list of new texts, but if you have any suggestions or recommendations for texts to be included, please <a href="mailto:nususcorpus@gmail.com"> contact us</a>.
