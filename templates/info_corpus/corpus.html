  <h2>Corpus Details</h2>
  <p>The current corpus is somewhat limited, but I hope to continue OCRing and adding more texts. The initial corpus consisted of 24 texts and four different authors and was meant to fill a gap in current textual corpora in which Sufi and other texts are significantly underrepresented.</p>
  <p>In addition, and perhaps more importantly, I am encoding these texts according to the <a href="https://alraqmiyyat.github.io/OpenITI/">Open Islamicate Text Initiative's</a> (OpenITI) <a href="https://alraqmiyyat.github.io/mARkdown/">mARkdown schema</a>. Encoding these texts renders them "machine actionable" or, in other words, allows scholars to perform a variety of textual analyses. Once encoded, links to the files can be found while browsing the corpus. </p>
  <p>The initial corpus was OCR'd using ABBYY FineReader, but moving forward this project will use <a href="https://www.escriptorium.uk/">eScriptorium,</a> a digital palaeography framework. It uses the <a href="https://kraken.re/master/index.html">kraken</a> OCR engine, and for our project we use a kraken OCR model developped by the OpenITI team.
