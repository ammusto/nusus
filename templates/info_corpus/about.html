    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>As a digital humanities summer fellow at NYU, we received funding to create a machine actionable corpus of early Sufi texts and perform a variety of textual analyses. Realizing the utility of these digitized texts, we decided to build on this initial project and make our corpus open source and available online. This web project was built using the web framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
    <p>We also owe a debt to:
