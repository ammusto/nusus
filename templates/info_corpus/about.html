    <p>Antonio is a fifth year PhD candidate at New York University writing his dissertation on the formative period of Sufism. He works primarily with Arabic sources, but he is also interested in and works with Persian and Syriac texts. For more information on his research, please see <a href="https://nyu.academia.edu/AntonioMusto">his profile</a> on academia.edu.
