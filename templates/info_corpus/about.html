    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>As a digital humanities summer fellow at NYU, I received funding to create a machine actionable corpus of early Sufi texts and perform a variety of textual analyses. Realizing the utility of these digitized texts, I decided to build on this initial project and make my corpus open source and available online. This web project was built using the web framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
    <p>I also owe a debt to:
